# SimpleBlog.Web

Web server for SimpleBlog application.
This subproject is a SPA proxy that serves the Vue.js application.
Use it if for some reason you want to use ASP.NET Core as a proxy server.
In other cases, use the Vue.js application directly. See [ClientApp](./ClientApp/README.md)
for more information.
