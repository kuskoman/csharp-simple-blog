# SimpleBlog

Project built using C#, that allows functionalities like creating users, posts and comments.

## Motivation

This project was built as a university project. The code in this repository has lower quality than the code I usually write,
but the goal here was to learn and practice C# and try out new Vue.js version. The project is mostly not tested.
